The night that Summer and Raymond got married, I sat and listened to the rain come. 
I didn’t hear it at first. I wanted to go out for a cigarette. I heard the heater 
gurgling but barely noticed it. Then I thought I heard rain like a hardened rustle, 
like pieces of glass shaking lightly together. I looked out the window and couldn’t tell. 
The trees outside were dark and unmoving. Some wind caught a wind-chime – it sang – the 
wind dropped it. Then I knew.  Then the rain fell faster. It started to sound wet, 
like a river falling down stones. Some kind of hush swelled and shrank and moved, 
and that brushing sweep of hush sounded like wind, too. But now the wind-chimes were 
silent.
