*Written on January 16th, 1999, apparently in response to an 8th grade Language Arts assignment that required me to use, and place in bold font, specific vocabulary words.* <br/><br/>

If I could do anything, anything at all,  I would teach myself to live in the now - in the present - and not worry about yesterday, about tomorrow, about next year. <!--more--> I wouldn't worry so much about whether falling in love is a good idea or not, about whether my friends really hate me, or about how much time has **elapsed** between boyfriends, friends, hugs, or kisses. I wouldn't put myself through the **grueling** pain of wondering if things would get better tomorrow, or if I was happier yesterday, or if I'm really going to live the life I want to, or just fade unnoticed into the **desolate** remains of mankind.

I would remember that life is **precious**, and life *isn't* yesterday, or tomorrow, or next year, but it's now. This second...this moment... as I write this essay...

I wouldn't tire my brain and waste my tears wondering why my last **relationships** didn't work, and wondering if this one will, or if I'll just be alone in my own world; **ravenous**, hungry, *starving* for love but never reaching it, maybe because I reached too far or held too tight and somehow lost it.

And if I couldn't find someone to love me, I would at least love myself, and treat myself and my friends the way any human being deserves to be treated.

I would be humble - not only in not finding myself the greatest, but in not finding myself the worst, becaue both are equal states of egotism. I wouldn't find every fallen tear and broken dream to be terribly **traumatic**, because I would remember that things could be worse, and be thankful that they *weren't* worse. I wouldn't be **furious** at myself or those around me for every mistake, but remember that everyone's human, and if we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn, and therefore would never grow.

I would hold on to the **precious** moments, the rainbows and the sunsets and the "I love you's" and the weddings and the flowers and the music and the dance. I would hold onto anything beautiful, and try to share a little bit of it with the world. 

Everyone in this world carries one weapon, and that is pain and the ability to cause it, and if I could teach myself all these things I would also teach myself to keep my sword of pain in its **scabbard**, so as not to inflict pain on anyone, purposefully or not. 

I would regard life less **ruefully** and more joyfully, less grudgingly and more gratefully, and remember that just being alive is enough to be grateful for.

I would remember that when I do fall in love, either to trust the love or to give it up, rather than hang myself in the middle with dilemmas that so many teenagers like me suffer. Instead of letting tears fall because I love him and he doesn't love me, I would be able to either have the strength to give up or the faith to trust them, because what is love without trust?

What I was hurt I wouldn't try to hide the part of me that had been hurt in some tiny **alcove** of my soul, but let the wound heal naturally, because if you try too hard to heal any wound it will only last longer than necessary. 

But I'm only fourteen, only in eighth grade, and no matter how true or logical my words of wisdom may sound, trying to turn them around on myself is a totally different matter. But who's ever ready to accept wisdom right away? Maybe when I'm old and gray, and my joints are inflamed with **arthritis**, and my fourteen year old daugther comes to me for advice on *her* first love, I'll be able to give her advice that I have in some point in my life followed. 

But for now, I just wish that I was able to take such advice. I wish that when the wandering **merchant** of heartache tries to steal my heart and sell it for cheap money, a heart that *will* break easily, I would be able to sense his **poignant** smell from far off, and protect myself, but that won't happen.

How could it? I have so much more life to live, and somewhere along that twisted road there will be heartbreak, or there will be cowardice. Maybe none of this will ever come true, maybe my advice will go unheeded by the very person that issues it.

But if I could do anything, anything at all, it would be that. To live my life in the now.

*Love as if you've never been hurt, and dance as though no one's watching.*
