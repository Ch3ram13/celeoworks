Outside, it smells like when I loved you:<br/> 
wisps of smoke.<br/>

I walk, and leaves crack underneath my feet.<br/> 

One thing burns, another breaks<br/>
in everything<br/>
I write.<br/>

The trio is perfect:<br/>
this season of perpetual near death,<br/>
my writing,<br/>
thinking about you.
<br/>
