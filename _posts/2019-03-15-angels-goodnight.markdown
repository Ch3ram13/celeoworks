*Angel's Goodnight*  <!--more--> <br/>
<br/>
Sunset, Sunset over the Shining Sea<br/>
Sunset, Sunset, saying goodnight to me<br/>
Sunset's glory, just around the bend<br/>
Angel's voices, hidden by the wind.<br/>
The glorious background, given by the wings.<br/>
Whisper, whisper, the crickets begin to sing.<br/>
Goodnight Angels, say goodnight to me.<br/>
Sunset, Sunset, over the Shining Sea.<br/>  
<br/>

*Written when I was about seven- or eight-years-old, circa 1993-1994; the watercolor painting with the poem was created as a gift for a family member circa 1995. The watercolor originally had a photo of 9-year-old me attached to it, which necessitated shorter lines to make space for the photo, but this typed version presents the line breaks as I seem to vaguely remember them.)*
