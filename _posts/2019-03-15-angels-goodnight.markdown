*Written when I was about seven- or eight-years-old, circa 1993-1994; the watercolor painting with the poem was created as a gift for a family member circa 1995.*

*Angel's Goodnight*  
Sunset, Sunset over the Shining Sea  
Sunset, Sunset, saying goodnight to me <!--more-->  
Sunsets glory, just around the bend  
Angel's voices, hidden by the wind.  
The glorious background, given by the wings.  
Whisper, whisper, the crickets begin to sing.  
Goodnight Angels, say goodnight to me.  
Sunset, Sunset, over the Shining Sea.  



(*Note*: The watercolor originally had a photo of 9-year-old me attached to it, which necessitated shorter lines to make space for the photo, but this typed version presents the line breaks as I seem to vaguely remember them.)
