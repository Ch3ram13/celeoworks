><br/>~John Steinbeck, *To a God Unknown*
I don’t remember much.  There’s so little I’ve left unburied and unburnt.  But, I remember, I thought the shopping mall in my desert hometown was a castle.  I thought it was magical.  I had never ever seen a building bordered with so many thousands of tiny white lights before, and when the sun went and the lights were lit, the whole place sparkled. 

Enchanted Presence, my absolute favorite shop, of course sparkled too.   I couldn’t tell you anymore exactly what Enchanted Presence sold.  What comes to memory are hushed, twinkly things, velvet and crystal.  A lamp cast soft-rose colored glow, dimmed like candle-light.  Silvery, shivery piano music played softly in the background, like the tinkle of chandeliers from some secret ballroom hidden nearby. 

I knew where the ballroom was, too.  There was, I was certain, a secret second-story to the mall, the story behind the window at the top of the building, the window you could see from the parking lot, way up top, surrounded by the white lights and shimmering.  On the second story, I was sure of it, lived the king, and on the second story he kept court, and from the second story he always had people watching for the perfect little girl to invite to live in that part of the castle. 

So I always was careful to be the perfect little girl.  I would wear my white velvet dress with a puffed-up petticoat underneath, and tiny dangling pieces of glittering plastic embroidered in it and dangling from it like diamonds; I brushed my hair till it shone.  I wore my polished black shoes.  

And I went to Enchanted Presence and listened to the quiet music and walked around and waited for the king to decide to make me a princess, to adopt me as his daughter, to come and take me away to the castle on the second story of the mall, away from it all forever and ever.

And I don’t remember what it all was, that I wanted to be taken away from forever.  I just remember the Christmas lights.  The castle in the middle of the desert.  Velvet and crystal and quiet things lying around, half-hidden and sparkling.
