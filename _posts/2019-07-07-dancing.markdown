a quiet pyromaniac
she sits quite still, on edge
at the fire
mind tangled around
her old lovers' hands
caressing his guitar
wooing the sparks,
her eyes drawn toward dancing gold
where cryptic symbols throb
in aging bark.
she won't build up flames,
touch lighter fluid
or even snap 
the disk on the bic
to light the
trembling cotton
at her lips.
she
loves the flickering tongues
with a quick brightness
shrinking more from
attraction
the swift pull
of fascination
than she ever has
or ever will
from heat.

(Written circa 2006)
