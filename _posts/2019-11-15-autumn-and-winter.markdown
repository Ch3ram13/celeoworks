*Again written in response to a writing prompt, this time in grad school circa 2014; I think of this poem as an extension of "on: autumn, by: winter"... only this time, the seasons are speaking to one another, and it is much later in the relationship.*
<br/>
<br/>
*Autumn*
<br/>
I think I am not barren. I am sure<br/>
I offered something – what?  Plump round things<br/>
all ripened in the sky. You never saw that.<br/>
When we met, the sun was rising, and you<br/>
in your pale sequins blended every shade, each<br/>
rosy finger true. You saw me coming<br/>
right? I thought I came for you. I was<br/>
a widow yesterday; today I am<br/>
a phoenix. Tomorrow, I will dance and shake<br/>
until I am stripped bare. The children, they<br/>
all love me. I teach them to try new things.<br/>
You see, I live to love, and love I know,<br/>
I know conversion. Yes, first I was her,<br/>
then I was on fire; next I’ll be you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>                       
                        *Winter*
                        
                        I don’t know what you want.
                        I never asked for broken pieces.
                        I only thought that you could help me capture
                        so much fading light.
