*Autumn*

I think I am not barren. I am sure 
I offered something – what?  Plump round things 
all ripened in the sky. You never saw that. 
When we met, the sun was rising, and you
in your pale sequins blended every shade, each
rosy finger true. You saw me coming 
right? I thought I came for you. I was 
a widow yesterday; today I am 
a phoenix. Tomorrow, I will dance and shake 
until I am stripped bare. The children, they 
all love me. I teach them to try new things. 
You see, I live to love, and love I know, 
I know conversion. Yes, first I was her,  
then I was on fire; next I’ll be you. 


                        
                        *Winter*
                        
                        I don’t know what you want.
                        I never asked for broken pieces.
                        I only thought that you could help me capture
                        so much fading light.




(Again written in response to a writing prompt, this time in grad school circa 2014; I think of this poem as an extension of "on: autumn, by: winter"... only this time, the seasons are speaking to one another, and it is much later in the relationship.)
