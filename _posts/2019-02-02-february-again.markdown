Your first three months, I thought you were, like, a spy, or somebody who came to analyze everyone else. The floor-length tan trench coat didn’t help.Or sitting in the back not saying anything. What were you thinking all that time? Three months is a long time around here to go without introducing yourself. So you say you teach college. Huh. I thought you said you were a student. An editor, too? And a business owner? A tutor? Well, that’s okay, hon. A lot of us chameleon our way around at first. Most of us lie, too, until we learn better. That woman over there, she used to be around in the Tenderloin, you know, earning her fix. She’s a damn good woman. Community leader. I admire her a lot. Maybe you want to introduce yourself to her. Think you’ll speak up tonight? Sure, just do it while everyone’s sharing. Tell you what, I challenge you. Stand up, say who you are, get some numbers. Start calling people. Well, I don’t know what social anxiety is, exactly, but I’m sure we’ve all got it in one form or another. Trust me, you start reaching out to people, you’ll find out all kinds of things you never knew. What’s possible for you, you know? Just make … how about three phone calls next week. No? How about a few texts? Atta girl. Before you know it, you’ll be the woman you always wanted to be. And don’t worry about your husband. I didn’t want to be touched by my man the whole first year. Oh, no, it’s alright! Yeah, you’re shaking. Hey, come here. There you go. Just give it some time, he’ll understand. You’re not out there polluted anymore, that’s the thing. Just keep coming back. This is the easier, softer way. <!--more-->
