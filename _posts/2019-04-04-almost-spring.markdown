Today, Ella writes at the library. She finds herself a quiet window seat in a corner with a view of the gardens across the street. She feels a strange kind of restless. She crosses her legs and jiggles her angle quickly. It’s not easy to write, this warm afternoon.<!--more--> Good lord, the sun is shining outside. The trees immediately in her field of vision are thin and white, with tiny green leaves that seem to shiver delightedly in the wake of every breeze that wafts by. 

It is almost springtime. Everybody seems to be wearing fewer clothes. Ella watches a young man jogging by; she thinks that she has never noticed before that men, too, start to show more skin when the weather warms. His calves are strong and solidly muscled, his leg hair dark and pleasantly sparse. He has long brown hair that bounces and shines in the sun. She imagines him holding a guitar and thinks that he would probably handle it pretty well. She next finds herself watching a small Asian woman in her sixties, walking briskly in capris and a bright pink tanktop. Her breasts are small and relaxed; they seem to rest against her ribcage comfortably. Her hips are round, almost swollen, and though she walks with a quick yet careful stride, there is a bit of a hop in her walk. 

Yes, it is almost springtime, and Ella is more aware of it than ever. And it is almost time for Vegas, and Ella is not sure what to expect. She wants to dance with eighteen men and fourteen women. She wants to make the mistake, for the first and last time in her life, of caterwauling publicly to drunken karaoke. She wants to drink champagne on a rooftop in the warm spring night air and have a strange and handsome man light her cigarette while in mid-conversation with somebody else, without even looking at her. He would simply know that she needed a light, and supply it, confidently, without breaking his stride. She wants to make love to Rose. But instead, she will find that along with her sunscreen, her sunglasses, her cash and her cigarettes, she will bring to Vegas every inhibition that she has ever carried around at home. 

The women in Vegas unfold their flesh out of their clothing like bright flowers unfurling in the dawn’s light, and Ella will not be able to speak to them. She will not be able to touch Rose sober, and will be unwilling to touch her drunk. Her skimpy dresses will remain folded carefully at the bottom of her bag. She will try, hard, to seize the moment and live outside of her day-to-day reality, but will ultimately become only more aware of how inescapable her self-constructed reality really is. She will learn in an instant that slot machines block the white noise and head-splitting chaos of day-to-day existence more effectively than any exercise, any sex, any drug she has ever tried, and she will quit the slot machines $11.00 later. Her Saturday will be spent in a nauseated hungover haze, watching Twilight on repeat on the hotel television. She will drink champagne on the stone bench in the smoking area in front of the timeshare. She will light her own cigarettes.
