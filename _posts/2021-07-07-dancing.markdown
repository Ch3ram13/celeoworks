*Written in San Rafael, CA circa 2006. Many epic and hidden beach bonfire nights with friends preceded this poem.*
<br/>
<br/>
a quiet pyromaniac<br/>
she sits quite still, on edge<br/>
at the fire<br/>
mind tangled around<br/>
her old lovers' hands<br/>
caressing his guitar<br/>
wooing the sparks,<br/>
her eyes drawn toward dancing gold<br/>
where cryptic symbols throb<br/>
in aging bark.<br/>
she won't build up flames,<br/>
touch lighter fluid<br/>
or even snap<br/>
the disk on the bic<br/>
to light the<br/>
trembling cotton<br/>
at her lips.<br/>
she<br/>
loves the flickering tongues<br/>
with a quick brightness<br/>
shrinking more from<br/>
attraction<br/>
the swift pull<br/>
of fascination<br/>
than she ever has<br/>
or ever will<br/>
from heat.<br/>
