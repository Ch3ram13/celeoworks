Four miles past the four seasons resort you're blasting bat outta hell, pushing eighty, igniting the stark grey gash between the tehachapi mountains and *yes,* there it *is,* hours *in,* that epiphanic moment when your car flies out of eden, across the baked ground and it's gasping before you . . . your land. We all have to learn how to just call home sweet home again. You're flying now. It's cooler in the breeze and something rears back to life inside of you, that gaping hole of a cobra's mouth that you used to keep so well fed. Back then, you could only survive for so long surrounded by taupe. Bright colors might seem like a happy solution but then you weren't after that that you wanted experience so you sank into coal-lead-lava rock draping black across your tits, your ass, but then vibrant dye in such glaring light is a masochist's Hollywood charade, like neon, like fake neon flowers made you cringe and scissored across your eyelids for days, like how glo-paint can make your irises feel singed. You're probably frightened somewhere, maybe sometimes the cracks in your voice can rival the cracks in the dirt, that sharp split in the cliff, goddamn it, the fault line itself if that's what it comes to but hey. No, hey. Let's not forget simple pleasures. Sunburns are a test of the spirit or will, guilty good fun, best of all the directions are simple. Peel off the excess and toss it, and no one will know. You want to be as pink on the outside as you are in your organs, to scream it with pride *I'm alive, there's no need to come in!* There's no need to come in. Over time, it's true sun will cook you through, a deep red solid bright clay figurine. You're still baking fever into your bones. The safest thing there is, there's no need to touch. Fragility loses its meaning when your flesh is too hot to brush fingertips across.

<br/>
Your fingerprints burn off even on your own skin and years later you'll be back there, staring at the spot where the girl that you think you once knew evaporated from
