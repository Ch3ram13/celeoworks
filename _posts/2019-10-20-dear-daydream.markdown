You were the prettiest thing I ever did see.  Sneaking up behind me at the oddest times 
—when I was slicing carrots by the stove or walking by the mailbox — surprising me so I'd freeze and my stomach stung like if a secret lover had just barely laid his fingertips on my waist. 


But there was no lover. 


Stealing my breath like breath was a ribbon I'd swallowed and you slowly drew it out from between my teeth.

But there was no gift. 

*taibhse.*

*álainn taibhse.*

Breathless and Narniac and colorful. Bright shade cast through a stained glass window.  Sunlight or the memory of sunshine or the promise of sunshine, promises like fools' gold and rainbows.  Always dancing one step away, then gone.

We all have our *mayas.*



(Excerpt from QIL, written in Soldotna, Alaska in July of 2009)
