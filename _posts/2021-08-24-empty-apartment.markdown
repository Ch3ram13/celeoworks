I wake, dear husband, like a monk kneeling down.<br/>
I wake quiet as a cloud.<br/><br/>
The earthquake stops. Why? That altarâ€™s<br/>
loosely held sand,<br/>
bright antique vases on the edge,<br/>
thin paper lantern and wooden shelves,<br/>
we built of good counsel.<br/>
<br/>
Where is your book you left on the table?<br/> 
I closed it and put it away.<br/>
Amen. I speak when no one listens. I listen. I<br/>
sing low, turn every light off, I sleep sound.<br/> 
<br/>
