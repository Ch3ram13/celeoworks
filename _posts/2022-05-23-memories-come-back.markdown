*Written in response to a grad school prompt, circa 2014, that asked us to create a poem with the same title as a random newspaper article.*
<br/>
<br/>
Mosquito repellent in
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a box, the birthing song
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;tsunami,
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tumult, 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;air
