*Excerpt from my 2007-2010 blog [QIL](/assets/QIL.pdf); written in Turlock, California in October of 2009, while I was remembering the day I began to fall in love with Sean LeeAnne.*
<br/>
>*That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me.  But, it is the same with any life.  Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been.  Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.* ~ Charles Dickens, *Great Expectations*

Picking  at splinters on the lawn one year ago beneath a bright October-blue sky -- I think when I'm eighty I'll still remember it for the inevitable chain of events, the unshakeable shift of energies and priorities and longings that immediately began to take place-- and I'll remember it fondly, I'm sure, and I hope with still  just a touch of sadness.  A distant minor chime.  

I don't know if I told you, but after quitting the smoking and slowing the drinking and waking to the world and learning to be happy, I did in fact quit daydreaming, after all. Well, at least consciously and deliberately doing so.  Every night I fall asleep and the dreams I refused to dream during the day build themselves up all around me like a giant shiny bubble, and every day I wake up and pop the bubble and walk all through the falling dreams like the figurine in the snow-globe surrounded by so much shattered glitter. 

And suddenly I do see just how easy it is to be happy in real life -- how I'd almost have to force myself not to be.  Overall averaged-out happy.  And this sadness I do feel, it's not that old desperate struggle against an invisible enemy, that raging hopeless battle that felt like it would never end ever because there was nothing tangible to fight.  It's a deeper sadness, more ancient, one I'm more alert to, more reactive toward, a kind that brings my hands to my face and my knees to the ground, but that I know and understand and am proud to feel again.

And the leaves are falling too and the magic of *Michelmass* swells and ebbs and I'm older, I've become graceful.  I'm stronger.  Yet I must admit that I am somehow a bit disoriented.  Autumn is almost always the season when I fall in love, and this year I've nowhere to go but out.
