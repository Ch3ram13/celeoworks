oh *god,* she falls to pieces
around me.

        warm,
        
            prismatic
pieces.
 
      a fiery mosaic, 

  
  shattered stained glass,
 


    garnet 


petals
 
 
 
            kissing 
 
 
 
 
    golden
 
 
 
 flames,
 
 
 
 
 
              still
 
 
 
      falling.






(Written in response to a writing prompt in college circa 2004, this was an attempt to speak in the voice of the season of autumn who, like a literary character, has fallen in love with the season of winter and so has written a poem about her. This poem has also been published in *Tuxedo Literary Magazine: Fall/Winter 2013*).
