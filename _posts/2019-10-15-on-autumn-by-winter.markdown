*Written in response to a writing prompt in college circa 2004, this was an attempt to speak in the voice of a personified season of winter who has fallen in love with the season of autumn and so has written a poem about her.* 
<br/>
<br/> <pre>
oh *god,* she falls to pieces <br/>
around me <!--more--> 
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp warm, 
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp prismatic 
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pieces.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>      
a fiery mosaic,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>shattered stained glass,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>garnet
<br/>
<br/>
petals
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>>>kissing
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>>golden
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>>flames,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>still
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>falling
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note: This poem has also been published in *Tuxedo Literary Magazine: Fall/Winter 2013*.
