*Written in response to a writing prompt in college circa 2004, this was an attempt to speak in the voice of a personified season of winter who has fallen in love with the season of autumn and so has written a poem about her.* <br/>

oh *god,* she falls to pieces <br/>
around me <!--more-->


>>>>>warm, 


>>prismatic 


>>>pieces.


            
a fiery mosaic,



>>shattered stained glass,
 


>>>>>garnet


petals
 
 
 
 >>>>>>>kissing
 
 
 
 
 >>>>golden
 
 
 
 flames,
 
 
 
 
 
 >>>>>>still
 
 
 
 >>>falling
 
 
 
 
 
 Note: This poem has also been published in *Tuxedo Literary Magazine: Fall/Winter 2013*.
