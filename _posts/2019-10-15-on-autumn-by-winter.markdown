*Written in response to a writing prompt in college circa 2004, this was an attempt to speak in the voice of a personified season of winter who has fallen in love with the season of autumn and so has written a poem about her. This poem has also been published in [Tuxedo Literary Magazine](https://tuxedoartsjournal.com/"Tuxedo Literary Magazine"), in the Fall/Winter 2013 issue, which is archived [here](https://scholar.dominican.edu/tuxedolit/vol2013/iss2/).

<br/>
oh *god,* she falls to pieces <br/>
around me 
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; warm, 
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; prismatic 
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pieces.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>      
a fiery mosaic,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>shattered stained glass,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>garnet
<br/>
<br/>
petals
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>>>kissing
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>>golden
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>>>flames,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>still
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>>falling
<br/>
