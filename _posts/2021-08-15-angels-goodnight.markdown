Sunset, Sunset, over the Shining Sea<br/>
Sunset, Sunset, saying goodnight to me<br/>
Sunset's glory, just around the bend<br/>
Angel's voices, hidden by the wind<br/>
The glorious background, given by the wings<br/>
Whisper, Whisper, the crickets begin to sing<br/>
Goodnight, Angels<br/>
Say Goodnight to me<br/>
Sunset, Sunset<br/>
Over the Shining Sea<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

*Palmdale, circa 1993, seven years old
