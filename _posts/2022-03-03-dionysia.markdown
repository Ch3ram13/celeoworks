*Written circa 2007 about that one fall semester in college when everybody fell in love...*
<br/>
<br/>
We might have been high<br/> 
on sugar crystals,<br/>
burning money like cigarettes,<br/>
blending harmonies like<br/>
playful spiders leap-<br/>
frogging on toy piano keys<br/>

Flame-haired gypsy nonconformist<br/> 
reformed fallen angel jesters<br/>
dancing under broken<br/>
sprinkler fountains, howling<br/>
at the moon,<br/>
touching fingertips<br/>

*I think your tongue is tracing<br/>
rainbows on my lips.*<br/>

I know what complicated lace<br/>
we glimpse in loved onesâ€™ faces, and I know<br/> 
what prism glitter-globe bubble dreams we<br/>

breathe with our mouths,<br/>
trace with our tongues,<br/>
hold on our palms,<br/>
knowing, yes<br/> 
knowing<br/> 
even prism glitter-globe bubble dreams<br/>

*pop!*
<br/>
<br/>
