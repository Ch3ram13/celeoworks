I wake, dear husband, like a monk kneeling down.
I wake quiet as a cloud.
The earthquake stops. Why? That altarâ€™s
loosely held sand,
bright antique vases on the edge,
thin paper lantern and wooden shelves,
we built of good counsel.

Where is your book you left on the table? 
I closed it and put it away.
Amen. I speak when no one listens. I listen. I
sing low, turn every light off, I sleep sound.
