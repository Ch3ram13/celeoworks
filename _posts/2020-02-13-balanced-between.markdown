*Written for a grad school assignment circa 2014, most of the lines and thematic content of this serial poem were derived from certain segments of my 2007-2010 blog [QIL](assets/QIL.pdf), which had been written during a 9-month period of deliberate and reflective celibacy. FYI, if you wouldn't be comfortable getting a glimpse into some intimate details of my sex life, don't [download the PDF].*
