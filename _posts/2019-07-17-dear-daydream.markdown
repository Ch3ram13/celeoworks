You were the prettiest thing I ever did see.<!--more--> Sneaking up behind me at the oddest times 
— when I was slicing carrots by the stove or walking by the mailbox — surprising me so I'd freeze and my stomach stung like if a secret lover had just barely laid his fingertips on my waist. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But there was no lover. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stealing my breath like breath was a ribbon I'd swallowed and you slowly drew it out from between my teeth.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But there was no gift. 
<br/>

<br/>
*álainn taibhse.*
<br/>
<br/>
Breathless and Narniac and colorful. Bright shade cast through a stained glass window.  Sunlight or the memory of sunshine or the promise of sunshine, promises like fools' gold and rainbows.  Always dancing one step away, then gone.
<br/>
<br/>
We all have our *mayas.*
<br/>

Excerpted from my 2007-2010 blog "QIL," this was written in Soldotna, Alaska in July of 2009, in the afterglow of the heights of a romance with a lover whom I refer to, in various pieces of writing, as "Sean LeAnne."
