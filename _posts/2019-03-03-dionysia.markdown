We might have been high <b>
on sugar crystals, <b>
burning money like cigarettes,
blending harmonies like
playful spiders leap-
frogging on toy piano keys.

Flame-haired gypsy nonconformist 
reformed fallen angel jesters
dancing under broken
sprinkler fountains, howling
at the moon,
touching fingertips:

*I think your tongue is tracing
rainbows on my lips.*

I know what complicated lace
we glimpse in loved onesâ€™ faces, and I know 
what prism glitter-globe bubble dreams we
breathe with our mouths,
trace with our tongues,
hold on our palms,
knowing, yes 
knowing 
even prism glitter-globe bubble dreams

in sunlight, brushed by treetops, lifted by 
unexpected laughter, and filled
full of brimming harmonies, do

*pop!*
