Written circa 2007 about that one fall semester in college when everybody fell in love...

We might have been high 
on sugar crystals,
burning money like cigarettes,
blending harmonies like
playful spiders leap-
frogging on toy piano keys. <!--more--> 

Flame-haired gypsy nonconformist 
reformed fallen angel jesters
dancing under broken
sprinkler fountains, howling
at the moon,
touching fingertips:

*I think your tongue is tracing
rainbows on my lips.*

I know what complicated lace
we glimpse in loved onesâ€™ faces, and I know 
what prism glitter-globe bubble dreams we
breathe with our mouths,
trace with our tongues,
hold on our palms,
knowing, yes 
knowing 
even prism glitter-globe bubble dreams

in sunlight, brushed by treetops, lifted by 
unexpected laughter, and filled
full of brimming harmonies, do

*pop!*
