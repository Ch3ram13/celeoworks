*Recorded in San Rafael, CA in April of 2018... <!--more--> Predictably, this recording is a little clunky with several obvious errors. When I learned this cover in the spring of 2018, I was just returning to the piano after barely touching it for a bunch of years, having been driven back to the instrument for help processing and expressing my feelings for a guy I was falling in love with. Up to this point, I had mostly been composing my own flawed and simple covers of love songs and sending them to him; this particular arrangement, however, was borrowed from a tutorial that was posted on YouTube at the time (I can't find it now to credit it!), and I began playing it that spring as a way to grapple with feelings, not of deep love, but of constant restlessness... and of a yearning, which today is mostly satisfied, to burn my then-current life to the ground and start over somewhere warm, dry, and flat.*
