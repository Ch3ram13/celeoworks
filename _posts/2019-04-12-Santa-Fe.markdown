*Recorded in San Rafael, CA in April of 2018...Predictably, this recording is a little clunky with several obvious errors. When I learned this cover in the spring of 2018, I was just returning to the piano after barely touching it for a bunch of years. Up to this point, I had mostly been composing my own flawed and simple covers of love songs and sending them to a man referred to elsewhere in my work as "Dillon III" or "The Dillon Who Prevailed." This particular arrangement, however, was borrowed from a tutorial that was posted on YouTube at the time (I can't find it now to credit it!), and I began playing it that spring as a way to grapple with feelings, not of deep love, but of constant restlessness... and of a yearning, which today is mostly satisfied, to burn my then-current life to the ground and start over somewhere warm, dry, flat, and affordable.*
