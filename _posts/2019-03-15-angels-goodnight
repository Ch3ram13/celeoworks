Insert Image: Angels' Goodnight


*Angel's Goodnight* (Original Text)
Sunset, Sunset over the Shining Sea
Sunset, Sunset, saying goodnight to me
Sunsets glory, just around the bend
Angel's voices, hidden by the wind.
The glorious background, given by the wings. 
Whisper, whisper, the crickets begin to sing.
Goodnight Angels, say goodnight to me. 
Sunset, Sunset, over the Shining Sea. 


(Poem written circa 1993-1994; watercolor painting with the poem created as a gift for a family member circa 1995)

(*Note*: The watercolor originally had a photo of 9-year-old me attached to it, which necessitated shorter lines to make space for the photo, but this typed version presents the line breaks as I seem to vaguely remember them.)
