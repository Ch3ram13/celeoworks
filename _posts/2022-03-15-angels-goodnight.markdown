Sunset, Sunset, over the Shining Sea
Sunset, Sunset, saying goodnight to me
Sunset's glory, just around the bend
Angel's voices, hidden by the wind
The glorious background, given by the wings
Whisper, Whisper, the crickets begin to sing
Goodnight, Angels
Say Goodnight to me
Sunset, Sunset
Over the Shining Sea
