A place to dream. Here are a few of the projects, from the easily accessible to the overwhelmingly ambitious, that I’d like to play with eventually: 

- Pulling together a small band to perform at recovery centers, rehab facilities, jails, and prisons 
- Writing a one-act play about a woman widowed only shortly after marrying her wife
- Writing a serial-play about the lives of college students and faculty at a performing arts school who are all members of the school’s Open Mic club
- Writing a retelling of Dante’s Inferno, with a central character who is recovering from drug and alcohol addiction while traveling, by foot, from Southern to Northern California 
- Re-recording the piano and vocal covers I’ve worked on over the last year, using much better equipment 
- Beginning a “Powerful Language” weekly group at a local library, jail, or prison to explore and become increasingly sophisticated wielding various forms of multilingualism and linguistic dexterity: code-switching, standard academic English, other forms of spoken and written English, languages other than English, profanity, rhetoric, jargon, “slang,” etc.
- Sewing a quilted holiday tree-shirt with my mom
- Inspired completely by ————, embarking upon a kissing tour of America
